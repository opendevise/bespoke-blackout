Toggles pause mode when either the kbd:[b] or kbd:[.] key is pressed while giving a http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js[Bespoke.js] presentation.
Give your audience a breather.

TIP: If you have form elements in your slides, use the https://github.com/markdalgleish/bespoke-forms[bespoke-forms] plugin to prevent pause mode toggle from being triggered while typing.
